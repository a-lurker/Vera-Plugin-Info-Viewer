This plugin, originated by @a-luker, allows you to look at the logs in Vera plus a variety of other useful pieces of information, including info about any attached Zwave devices.

Very useful additions were also written by user @gengen, in particular the "ZShark" Z-Wave protocol interpreter. Verbose logging needs to be enabled for this feature to work. Note that Verbose logging without logging to USB, is not recommended for ongoing operation.
